# Digital Marketplace scripts functional tests

These files are [cram] tests that should exercise the major features of a script.

These tests may communicate with an instance of the Digital Marketplace. If you wish to run them locally you will need to have the apps running locally.

They can be run using `make functional-tests` from the digitalmarketplace-scripts directory.
